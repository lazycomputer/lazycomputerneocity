	<h1>i love using zines to process</h1>
	<i>May 8th, 2025</i>
	<p>After just churning out 5 mini zines (and a website) in one day, I decided that there was no better way to process this phenomena than with another zine. It really was a phenomena because I haven't been so productive in an unremembered amount of time. After spending most of my sick day assembling this in the incredible <a href="https://alienmelon.itch.io/electric-zine-maker?download">Electric Zine Maker freeware</a> I had come to two conclusions. The first is what I describe in the zine, something about form guiding my thought process possibly, and the other is ~disability~ but i go more into that <a href="#downthere">\/ down there \/</a></p>

		<p>The last zines were extremely low effort, several sentence pieces I squeezed onto an oragami paper booklet. I made myself use a pen (no edits) and didn't have space for complicated drawings/paragraphs of writing. There was no room to get lost trying to cover every crook and cranny of a huge concept, I had to keep it to simple ideas/sensations. They keep the process simple and immediate and very tactile, which is all so helpful Making zines includes my distant, analytical nature and gets it involved with/and transition into an emotional process. </p>
		<p>But making standard A4 sized zines has been a touch less cathartic, and i think it relates to this interesting article i read today from the Electric Zine Maker's creator, alien melon. "<a href="https://www.nathalielawhead.com/candybox/the-wonderful-world-of-tools-made-by-small-teams-solo-devs-and-shareware-weird-beautiful-and-experimental-things-to-be-creative-in-an-analysis-on-building-for-approachability">The wonderful world of tools made by small teams, solo-devs, and shareware (weird, beautiful, and experimental things to be creative in + an analysis on building for approachability)</a>" is such a good read and theres so much for me to keep delving into BUT i was reminded of the intimidation of a blank canvas/the expection of a polished product. The EZM was approachable enough that I was able to keep coming back to my original idea, with new (sometimes unrelated/cluttered) pieces, but without the care of it being good enough to anyone but me cos im playing!! it may be a bit all over the place (and occassionally undreadable) but god did i have fun makin it! </p>
