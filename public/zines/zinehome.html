	<h1>Welcome to my Zine archive</h1>
	<i>May 6th, 2025</i>
	<p>I started making zines around 2023 after clumsily scratching the surface of the local scene and being transfixed by the variety in the creators' work. I thought I had just found another hobby for my endless collection that helped fast track seratonin to my barren brain. It wasn't that, instead I found one of the most accessible art forms that I always return to when I am desperate to express myself. </p>
	<p>So I've collected as many as I could and uploaded them here, for your scrollable pleasure, and probably added some comments about my process becaaauuussseee im pretentious </p>
