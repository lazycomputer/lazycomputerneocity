	<h1>i feel more comfortable when confined</h1>
	<i>May 7th, 2025</i>
	<p>I wrote this today after finally showering in the first time in way too long but I don't think it's about that at all, just thought you should know I wasn't stinky when I made it. </p>
	<p>I just put pen to paper and the next thing I knew, I'd had this. I think I was reflecting on the sort of isolation I often feel as an autistic/neurodivergent person who puts so so much effort into making myself understood by the many neurotypical people who don't even spare a moment to listen, let alone put in the effort to meet me halfway in the ways we communicate. It's an exhausting cycle that has worn it's well trodden path in my brain and I hope one day I'll have walked enough that it won't even show up as an instinct at all</p>
