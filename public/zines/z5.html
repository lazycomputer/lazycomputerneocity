	<h1>i'm not responding to my support coordinator</h1>
	<i>May 7th, 2025</i>
	<p>Okay I've been fuckin churnin' these out today. They're honestly great for helping me process stuff (i might even make a zine about that GOD WHAT IS WITH ME) and I've kinda made an upload template that's easy for me to use so updating each of them hasn't been a toll either. Fingers crossed the scanner and my formula don't change because I'm autistic and I hate that ! !  </p>
	<p>This Zine is just me venting about how hard it is to ask for help when you're just so overwhelmed with all the pain and unfulfilled needs that my ability to even comprehend my reality just ▰▰▰▰▰...
