	Hey there! The main page of this site is not compatible with mobiles (an alternate version is in the works) and was made for firefox
	<p>This site is 18+ as I frequently touch on intense subjects i have experience with (ie. trauma, mental health, sex, sexuality, ableism, abuse, violence, ect) </p>
	<p>Many pages contain flashing gifs, check the site map for more accessibility details and page specific content warnings</p>
