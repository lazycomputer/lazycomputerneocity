		<h1>second blog post</h1> 
        <h2> 30 May, 2025</h2>
		i published my last blog post and updated the sitemap. i want this stuff to be more accessible and i will get it done, it'll just take a lot more time than i'd like. im doing all the therapy things though and just letting the stuff i make be whatever it is. i just can't muster much accuracy but! a really cute girl who's really good at art told me my art is very "expressive" so im winning all around.
        <p>it helps me feel less pressure to make my websites too complicated. posting the simplest layouts possible becayse thats all i can muster is another causation from all the shit going on and with my shit memory, I always appreciate landmark indicators whenever im struggling to remember anything about past experiences. I wanna make some sort of webpage dedicated to anthology of the killer and how i soppily clutch it to my chest. i wanna check out all the stuff the catamites mentioned looking at while making the game and list my sort of scrapbook thoughts and feelings related to the game and the various killers. It's on it's way already, bb and i share hyperverbal tendencies
        <p>In the meantime, videogames have been able to reach me while limited to being exclusively horizontal. I've uploaded some gameboy ROMS onto my phone (hopefully keeping me off social media) and I am so impressed with the capacity these things have for expression. The ability to portray an engaging story with limited resource is impressive to me like little else but ive been just as engaged to a story told in sentences than one allowed multiple books (eg ~337). im overwhelmed how much joy mario and luigi superstar saga has already evoked with their incredibly charming pixel art animations. im grateful that so many dedicated archivists have made it possible for me to experience these games, on my phone too? my phone so slow my partner agonises watching me try to order from fast food apps. I've removed as much as I could from it, all photos, most apps besides some neccessary for daily function and a couple games i wasted way too much time in to feel totally able to just throw it all away. GB games don't seem to slow my phone down at all, and certainly not by loading endless ads and data tracking shit. sure im isolated but my energy is stolen by things i didn't consent to it being spent on.  </p>
        <p>eventually i will make a page archiving how the site used to look</p>
